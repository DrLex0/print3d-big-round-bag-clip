## Description and Instructions

This is a print-in-place clip for sealing large bags like garbage bags, or any other large bag whose odor/humidity/dryness is best kept inside. The usual flat clips that bend around the bag may become difficult to use for large or thick bags, therefore this one is round and rigid, and relies on the flexibility of the bag itself.<br>
It can also be useful to hold cables or hoses together, or for any other application where a round clip comes in handy. Although the clip is easy to open and close, it can withstand quite a bit of force. An extra loop of tape can help to keep the clip secure.

It comes in several inner diameters:
- 24Â mm (outer 33Â mm),
- 28Â mm (outer 37.5Â mm),
- 32Â mm (outer 42Â mm),
- 38Â mm (outer 49Â mm).

If you need diameters in between these values or slightly above 38Â mm, simply scale up the nearest smaller model in the XY plane by the appropriate factor (e.g. for 34Â mm, scale up the 32Â mm model by 34/32 or 106.25%). You may also be able to scale down from a larger model to a limited degree, depending on how accurate your printer is.


### Printing

The model is optimised to be printed at 0.2Â mm layers.
For extra strength, print with 3 perimeters, which makes infill rather irrelevant (I used 15%).

Compared to MasterFX' original clip, I did reduce the tolerances of the hinge to make it less sloppy, so this may require a more accurately tuned printer.
Like the original, this should print fine without supports. There is not much space anyhow to place supports, so enabling them might only incur a risk of the hinge being jammed up.

PLA may not be the best material for this, because it tends to become brittle over time, making it more likely for the hook to break off. PETG is better suited for this.


### Post-printing

You may need to use a knife or screwdriver to pry the hinge loose if some strands of filament got inside it. Don't be afraid to use a bit of force, the hinge is quite sturdy.
